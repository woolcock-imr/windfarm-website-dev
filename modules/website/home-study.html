					<span style="color:#000000;font-size:36px">Questions and Answers</span><br><br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research?</span><br><br>
					The Woolcock Institute is an inter-disciplinary research institute dedicated to understanding and treating respiratory and sleep disorders. With over 200 research and clinical professionals, we are a world leader in the area of research, clinical diagnosis and treatment. We are affiliated with the University of Sydney. The Woolcock Institute is located at 431 Glebe Point Road in the Suburb of Glebe in Sydney, NSW, Australia.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">What is the purpose of this study?</span><br>
					<br>
					Communities living near wind turbines have presented with a cluster of health symptoms sometimes called "Wind Turbine Syndrome".
					The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) has recently conducted a thorough review and did not find
					any scientifically robust studies that could definitively prove or disprove whether wind turbine noise causes human ill-health.
					Wind turbines generate noise that is below the audible range for humans (called infrasound) and nobody has yet conducted a
					scientific study in the community to determine whether it has any effects on humans. The purpose of this study is to investigate
					whether 6 months of wind turbine simulated infrasound has effects on human health measures when compared to no sound.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Am I eligible to participate in this study?</span><br>
					<br>
					Eligible participants are adults with normal hearing who report they are at least somewhat sensitive to noise and are willing
					to have speakers installed into their bedroom for 6 months. Our online screening questionnaire will determine whether you meet
					the full eligibility criteria.<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">What will the research involve?</span><br>
					<br>
					This study will require installation of 4 x 600mm cube speakers into your bedroom. People will be randomly allocated to receive
					infrasound speakers or no sound speakers. Because infrasound cannot be heard you will not know which speakers you have installed
					in your bedroom. These speakers will run for the 6 months of the study. Three times during this six months we will visit you at
					home to collect a range of health-related measurements (sleep, brain activity, reaction time, memory, heart rate and blood samples etc.).<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Will I get paid for participating in this research?</span><br>
					<br>
					We will reimburse you for the cost of electricity to power the speakers and in addition you will be reimbursed for your time.
					We will reimburse you $500 at each of the 3 and 6 month visits.				<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">What are the benefits of this study?</span><br>
					<br>
					There are no direct benefits to you by participating in this study. You may learn some interesting things about your sleep
					and other health measurements which you will be able to see on request. Your participation in this study will help in guiding
					future public policy about the health effects of wind turbines and traffic noise.				<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Are there any plans to build a wind farm in the area?</span><br>
					<br>
					The reason we have chosen this area is because it is far enough away from any existing
					wind farms and also far enough from noise of the busy city. We are not aware of any
					plans to build a wind farm in your area.				<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Why is there a study looking at noise from wind farms in my area?</span><br>
					<br>
					People who live in metropolitan areas may have different perception of sound to people who live
					outside of metropolitan areas.  We are selecting participants from non-metropolitan areas for
					this reason.				<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<span style="font-weight:bold;">Is the infrasound coming from the speakers harmful?</span><br>
					<br>
					Infrasound is present in nature and we are conducting this study to objectively measure whether
					exposure to infrasound has any effects.				<br>
